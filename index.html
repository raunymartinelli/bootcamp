    <h2>Sumary</h2>

    <p>Hello! I'm Rauny Martinelli, a veteran in the travel industry, now
    venturing into the exhilarating domain of computer programming.</p>
    <p>My two-decade journey, managing and strategizing operations
    across various travel companies in Brazil, has been a ride filled with
    strategic growth, team leadership, and market expansion.</p>
    <p>Why the shift to programming, you may ask? The digital world
    has always fascinated me and the recent global shifts have
    highlighted the crucial role of tech across all sectors, especially
    travel. It's not just a career change; it's a strategic move to blend my
    extensive industry insight with tech skills, aspiring to innovate travel
    experiences and operations digitally.</p>
    <p>Currently immersing myself in Computer Programming and Analysis
    at George Brown College, I am gearing up to navigate this new
    journey where travel meets technology.  </p>
    <p>Eager to connect with both travel and tech enthusiasts. Let’s
